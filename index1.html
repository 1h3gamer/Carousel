        <h1>About mysteries</h1>
        <h5>Mystery is a fiction genre where the nature of an event, usually a murder or other crime, remains mysterious until the
        end of the story.[1] Often within a closed circle of suspects, each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive
        and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime. The central character is often a detective (such as Sherlock
        Holmes), who eventually solves the mystery by logical deduction from facts presented to the reader.[2] Some mystery
        books are non-fiction. Mystery fiction can be detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle or suspense
        element and its logical solution such as a whodunit. Mystery fiction can be contrasted with hardboiled detective
        stories, which focus on action and gritty realism.</h5>

        <h1>Mysteries</h1>
        <p>Mystery fiction can involve a supernatural mystery in which the solution does not have to be logical and even in which
        there is no crime involved. This usage was common in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, whose titles such as
        Dime Mystery, Thrilling Mystery, and Spicy Mystery offered what were then described as complicated to solve and weird
        stories: supernatural horror in the vein of Grand Guignol. That contrasted with parallel titles of the same names which
        contained conventional hardboiled crime fiction. The first use of "mystery" in that sense was by Dime Mystery, which
        started out as an ordinary crime fiction magazine but switched to "weird menace" during the later part of 1933.[3]</p>
